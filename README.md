# OpenSourceRails

Welcome to the new OpenSourceRails. We've revamped the site as a simple static site generator for more speed, easier updates, and maintenance by a larger open source community.


## Submitting a new Project

We're managing new project submission via Github Issues. You can also send us a pull request.

[Submit a new Project here](https://github.com/railsjedi/opensourcerails/issues/new?title=Submit%20a%20new%20project&body=Description%20of%20Project)


## Submitting a Blog Post

You can also submit a guest blog post on Open Source Rails about your project (installation instructions, walkthrough guides, tips/tricks). If it's of high quality, we'll merge it in and feature it on our site.

You can either write the blog post as a github issue (in markdown), or fork the code of the site and check it in as blog/posts/[title].md
